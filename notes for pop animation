- we can't remove dead car from otherCars list right away - client.js line: 1082
	
	What we need to do here is leave the dead car in the otherCars list for a while until its pop 
	animation is complete (the car won't move because it's dead).
	
	To do this, we first mark it as dead (sprite.dead property)
	Then we set a flag, sprite.deathAnimation, to 1, we set it's ballon div background image to 
	balloonPoping1.png, and then start a timer (store a time stamp in a property) that lasts for 200ms.
	
	after 200ms are gone, reset timer and load balloonPoping2.png

	after 200ms are gone, reset timer and load balloonPoping3.png
	
	and so on, until all the animation sprites have been loaded. 
	
	Then remove the car from otherCars

	
	

- if our car is dead, line: 1046, we don't load the #splashscreen, we do balloon popping animation first 
then we load #splashscreen	


-lastly, to animate balloon pop, we need to have direct access to the balloon divs of the dead cars. This can 
only be done if we assign id to them. each ballon div with have an id = nickname of its car.
